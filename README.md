## Smart Campus Hiring Automation System

This is a full-cycle Business Analyst project designed to simulate a real-world Agile BA role. The system focuses on automating the end-to-end campus placement process for colleges, students, and recruiters.

## Project Objective

To design, plan, and document a smart web-based platform that:
- Allows students to register and apply for jobs
- Enables companies to post vacancies and schedule interviews
- Helps TPOs (Training & Placement Officers) manage interview slots and eligibility
- Provides admin dashboards and reports for performance tracking
